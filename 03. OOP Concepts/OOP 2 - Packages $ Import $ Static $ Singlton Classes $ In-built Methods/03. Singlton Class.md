# Singleton Class -

 A **Singleton Class** in Java is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance throughout the application lifecycle. This pattern is used when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system, such as in logging, configuration settings, or database connections.

### Key Characteristics of a Singleton Class:

1. **Single Instance**: Only one instance of the class can be created.
2. **Global Access Point**: The instance is globally accessible across the entire application.

### How to Implement a Singleton Class:

#### 1. Private Constructor

The constructor of the class is marked as `private` to prevent instantiation from outside the class.

#### 2. Static Instance

A private static variable holds the single instance of the class. This ensures that the instance is shared globally.

#### 3. Public Static Method

A public static method, often named `getInstance()`, returns the single instance. If the instance is not created, this method will create and return it.

### Example of a Singleton Class:

```java
public class Singleton {
    // Static variable that holds the single instance of the class
    private static Singleton instance;

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    private Singleton() {}

    // Public method to provide global access to the single instance
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            // Create the instance if it doesn't exist
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### Key Points:

- **Thread Safety**: In a multithreaded environment, if multiple threads call `getInstance()` simultaneously, multiple instances could be created. To prevent this, you can make the method `synchronized` or use a **Double-Checked Locking** mechanism.

#### Thread-Safe Singleton (Using Synchronized Method):

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    // Synchronized method to make it thread-safe
    public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

#### Double-Checked Locking:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### Use Cases of Singleton Pattern:

- **Database connection pooling**
- **Logger classes**
- **Caching**
- **Configuration settings**

By implementing a singleton, you ensure that only one instance of the class is used across the application, which can help in managing resources and ensuring consistency.
