# new Keyword -

In Java, the `new` keyword is used to create new objects and allocate memory for them on the heap. It's a fundamental part of Java's object-oriented programming model, allowing you to instantiate classes, which are blueprints for objects. Here's a detailed explanation of how the `new` keyword works:

### 1. **Creating Objects**

When you use the `new` keyword, Java performs the following steps:

- **Memory Allocation**: Allocates memory for a new object on the heap.
- **Constructor Call**: Invokes the constructor of the class to initialize the newly created object.
- **Reference Assignment**: Returns a reference to the memory location where the object is stored, which you can assign to a variable.

#### Example:

```java
class Car {
    String color;
    String model;

    Car(String color, String model) {
        this.color = color;
        this.model = model;
    }

    void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Car model: " + model + ", Color: " + color);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Red", "Tesla Model S"); // Using new keyword
        myCar.displayInfo(); // Output: Car model: Tesla Model S, Color: Red
    }
}
```

In this example, the `new Car("Red", "Tesla Model S")` statement does the following:

- Allocates memory for a `Car` object.
- Calls the `Car` constructor to initialize the `color` and `model` attributes.
- Assigns the reference of the created object to the variable `myCar`.

### 2. **The `new` Keyword with Arrays**

The `new` keyword is also used to create arrays. When creating an array, `new` allocates a contiguous block of memory for the specified number of elements.

#### Example:

```java
int[] numbers = new int[5]; // Creates an array of 5 integers
```

Here, `new int[5]` creates an array that can hold 5 integers and assigns the reference to the `numbers` variable.

### 3. **Anonymous Objects**

You can use the `new` keyword to create an object without assigning it to a variable. This is called an anonymous object and is typically used when the object is only needed for a single operation.

#### Example:

```java
new Car("Blue", "BMW X5").displayInfo(); // Output: Car model: BMW X5, Color: Blue
```

In this case, the `Car` object is created and used in the same line without being assigned to a variable.

### 4. **Custom Class Instances**

The `new` keyword is essential for creating instances of custom classes. Every time you define a new class and want to create objects from it, you will use `new`.

#### Example:

```java
class Person {
    String name;

    Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

Person p = new Person("Akshay"); // Creating an instance of Person class
```

### 5. **Memory Management and Garbage Collection**

When you create an object using `new`, Java allocates memory for it on the heap. The object remains in memory until there are no more references to it, at which point it becomes eligible for garbage collection. The `new` keyword ensures that memory is managed properly, and Java's garbage collector will eventually reclaim memory that is no longer needed.

### 6. **Other Uses**

- **Exception Handling**: `new` is used to create exception objects.
  
  ```java
  throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid argument");
  ```

- **Multithreading**: You can use `new` to create threads.
  
  ```java
  Thread t = new Thread(new Runnable() {
      public void run() {
          System.out.println("Thread is running");
      }
  });
  ```

### Summary

The `new` keyword in Java is a powerful tool for object creation, allowing you to instantiate classes, create arrays, and manage memory effectively. Understanding how `new` works is fundamental to mastering Java's object-oriented capabilities.
