In Java, the concepts of **pass by value** and **pass by reference** often lead to confusion, especially for those new to the language. To clarify, **Java is strictly pass by value**, but the way it handles objects can sometimes make it seem like pass by reference.

### 1. **Pass by Value**

When a method is called in Java, the arguments are passed by value. This means that a **copy** of the variable's value is passed to the method, not the actual variable itself. Any changes made to the parameter within the method do not affect the original variable.

#### Example with Primitive Types:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 5;
        modifyValue(x);
        System.out.println(x); // Output: 5
    }

    public static void modifyValue(int num) {
        num = 10; // This change does not affect the original 'x'
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: In this example, when `modifyValue(x)` is called, the value of `x` (which is `5`) is copied into the method parameter `num`. Changing `num` inside the method does not affect the original variable `x` in the `main` method.

### 2. **Pass by Value with Objects**

When it comes to objects, Java still uses pass by value. However, the value that is passed is a **reference** to the object, not the object itself. This can create the illusion that Java is passing by reference, but itâ€™s still passing a copy of the reference, not the actual object.

#### Example with Objects:

```java
class Car {
    String model;

    Car(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Tesla Model S");
        modifyCar(myCar);
        System.out.println(myCar.model); // Output: Model X
    }

    public static void modifyCar(Car car) {
        car.model = "Model X"; // This changes the 'model' of the original object
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: Here, `myCar` holds a reference to a `Car` object. When `modifyCar(myCar)` is called, the reference to the object is passed by value to the method. Inside `modifyCar`, the reference `car` still points to the same object on the heap as `myCar`, so modifying the object through `car` affects the original object referred to by `myCar`.

#### Example with Object Reassignment:

```java
class Car {
    String model;

    Car(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Tesla Model S");
        reassignCar(myCar);
        System.out.println(myCar.model); // Output: Tesla Model S
    }

    public static void reassignCar(Car car) {
        car = new Car("Model X"); // This does NOT change 'myCar' in the main method
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: In this case, `car` is a copy of the reference to the original `Car` object. When `car` is reassigned to a new `Car` object inside `reassignCar`, it only changes the local reference within the method. The original reference `myCar` in the `main` method still points to the original `Car` object, so the model remains "Tesla Model S."

### Summary

- **Pass by Value**: Java always passes arguments to methods by value. For primitive types, this means the actual value is copied. For objects, this means a copy of the reference (pointer) to the object is passed.
- **No Pass by Reference in Java**: Java does not support pass by reference. Even though object references are passed by value, they still point to the original objects, so changes to the object itself are reflected outside the method.

Understanding that Java is always pass by value is key to avoiding confusion, especially when working with objects and methods.
