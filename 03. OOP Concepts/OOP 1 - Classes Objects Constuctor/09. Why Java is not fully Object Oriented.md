# Why Java is not fully object oriented?

Java is often described as **not fully object-oriented** because it incorporates some features that do not align with the principles of pure object-oriented programming (OOP). Let's explore the reasons why Java is not considered 100% object-oriented:

### 1. **Primitive Data Types**

Java includes eight primitive data types (`byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`) that are not objects. They are simple data types that hold their values directly, without the overhead of an object. 

- **Why it's not OOP**: In a fully object-oriented language, everything is supposed to be an object. Primitive types in Java break this rule because they don't have methods, inheritance, or encapsulation features that objects have.

- **Workaround**: Java provides wrapper classes (`Integer`, `Boolean`, etc.) for each primitive type, allowing them to be treated as objects when necessary. However, this is more of a convenience feature and doesn't make the primitives themselves objects.

### 2. **Static Methods and Variables**

In Java, static methods and variables belong to the class rather than to instances (objects) of the class. Static members can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.

- **Why it's not OOP**: In pure OOP, behavior and state are typically associated with objects. Static methods and variables break this encapsulation by allowing behavior and state to exist independently of objects.

- **Workaround**: While static members are useful for certain programming paradigms, their existence contradicts the idea that everything should be an object.

### 3. **Lack of Support for Operator Overloading**

Java does not support operator overloading, a feature that allows operators to be redefined for user-defined types.

- **Why it's not OOP**: In a fully object-oriented language, operators should be able to behave like methods and be overloaded to work with objects in a manner consistent with OOP principles.

- **Workaround**: Java's designers chose simplicity over flexibility to avoid the complexity and potential confusion that operator overloading can introduce.

### 4. **Procedural Features**

Java allows procedural programming by enabling the use of static methods and variables, which are not tied to object instances. This permits a style of programming that is not object-oriented.

- **Why it's not OOP**: Object-oriented programming emphasizes designing software using objects, encapsulating data and behavior. Procedural features allow developers to bypass object-oriented principles, which can lead to non-OOP code.

- **Workaround**: While Java supports procedural programming, it encourages OOP through its design and standard practices, such as using classes and objects.

### 5. **Main Method as Entry Point**

In Java, the `main` method is a static method that serves as the entry point for any standalone application.

- **Why it's not OOP**: The `main` method can be seen as procedural because it is static and doesn't operate on an object instance. It also tends to lead to procedural-style code where program flow is controlled procedurally rather than through objects.

- **Workaround**: Even though `main` is procedural, it typically initializes objects and invokes methods on them, which aligns with OOP practices once the application is running.

### 6. **Primitive Array Types**

Java allows the creation of arrays of primitive types, which are not objects.

- **Why it's not OOP**: In a fully object-oriented language, arrays would be collections of objects, and primitives would need to be wrapped in their object counterparts.

- **Workaround**: Java does provide `ArrayList` and other collection classes that work with objects, but primitive arrays are more efficient and are still widely used.

### Summary

Java is not considered fully object-oriented because it includes elements like primitive data types, static methods and variables, and procedural programming features, which do not conform to the strict principles of object-oriented programming. However, Java is still predominantly object-oriented, and its design encourages object-oriented practices while allowing for performance optimizations and simplicity where needed. The inclusion of these non-OOP features is a trade-off made by Java's designers to balance object-oriented principles with practicality and efficiency.
