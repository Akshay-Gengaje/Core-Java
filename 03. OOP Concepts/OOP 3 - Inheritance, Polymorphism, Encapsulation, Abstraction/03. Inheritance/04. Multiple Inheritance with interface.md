# Multiple Inheritance with Interface -

In Java, **multiple inheritance** is not supported with classes due to ambiguity problems, commonly referred to as the **Diamond Problem**. However, **multiple inheritance** is supported through **interfaces**. Using interfaces, a class can implement multiple types, thereby achieving a form of multiple inheritance without ambiguity issues.

### Why Multiple Inheritance with Interfaces?

Java restricts multiple inheritance in classes to avoid conflicts when two parent classes have methods with the same signature. For example, if a class inherits two classes that both have the same method, the JVM wouldn’t know which method to execute. Interfaces solve this issue because they provide only method declarations (without implementations), leaving the actual implementation up to the class that implements the interface. This avoids ambiguity.

### How to Achieve Multiple Inheritance Using Interfaces

In Java, a class can implement more than one interface. This allows the class to inherit method signatures (but not method implementations) from multiple sources. Here’s an example:

#### Example: Multiple Inheritance with Interfaces

```java
interface Animal {
    void eat();
}

interface Bird {
    void fly();
}

class Bat implements Animal, Bird { // Bat can fly and eat, implementing both interfaces
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Bat is eating insects.");
    }

    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Bat is flying.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bat bat = new Bat();
        bat.eat();
        bat.fly();
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Bat is eating insects.
Bat is flying.
```

In this example, the class `Bat` implements two interfaces: `Animal` and `Bird`. This allows the `Bat` class to inherit the behaviors of both animals (like eating) and birds (like flying), achieving multiple inheritance.

### Key Points:

1. **Interfaces only contain method declarations** (abstract methods) by default. Any class that implements an interface must provide implementations for all the methods declared in the interface unless the class is declared abstract.
2. A class can **implement multiple interfaces**, allowing it to inherit from multiple sources.
3. **No method conflict**: Since interfaces don’t contain method implementations (just signatures), there’s no conflict over which method should be used, as the implementing class must provide the actual implementation.

### Default Methods in Interfaces

Starting from **Java 8**, interfaces can also contain **default methods** (methods with a body). If multiple interfaces have default methods with the same signature, the implementing class needs to resolve the conflict by overriding the method. This provides more flexibility, but it also introduces a potential need for conflict resolution.

#### Example: Multiple Inheritance with Default Methods in Interfaces

```java
interface Animal {
    default void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}

interface Bird {
    default void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bird chirping");
    }
}

class Bat implements Animal, Bird {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        // Resolve conflict by specifying which interface's default method to use
        Animal.super.sound();  // Calling Animal's sound method
        Bird.super.sound();    // Calling Bird's sound method
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bat bat = new Bat();
        bat.sound();
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Animal sound
Bird chirping
```

In this case, both `Animal` and `Bird` interfaces have a default `sound()` method. The `Bat` class resolves the conflict by explicitly calling the `sound()` method from both interfaces using `Animal.super.sound()` and `Bird.super.sound()`.

### Advantages of Using Interfaces for Multiple Inheritance:

1. **Flexibility**: A class can inherit behavior from multiple interfaces, allowing for a flexible design where classes can represent multiple roles.
2. **No Diamond Problem**: Since interfaces do not contain implementations (except for default methods), the ambiguity present in traditional multiple inheritance is avoided.
3. **Decoupling**: Interfaces provide a way to decouple the definition of behavior from the implementation, allowing different classes to implement the behavior in their own ways.
4. **Polymorphism**: Using interfaces, you can create highly polymorphic code where a single class can be used in multiple contexts (as instances of different interfaces).

### Diamond Problem in Multiple Inheritance

In traditional multiple inheritance (as seen in languages like C++), if two parent classes have methods with the same name and signature, the subclass can inherit conflicting method implementations. This is known as the **Diamond Problem**. Since Java uses interfaces and enforces that the implementing class provides the method implementation, the issue of ambiguity is resolved.

### Summary

- **Multiple inheritance** is supported in Java **only through interfaces**.
- A class can implement multiple interfaces and, thus, inherit the abstract methods (or default methods) defined in those interfaces.
- Starting from Java 8, interfaces can have **default methods**, allowing some level of method implementation within interfaces, but conflicts between default methods in multiple interfaces can be resolved by overriding the method in the implementing class.
