# Super Keyword -

In Java, the `super` keyword is used to refer to the **immediate parent class object**. It allows a subclass to access methods, constructors, and fields of its parent class. This keyword is particularly useful when there is a need to differentiate between a method or variable in the child class and one in the parent class, or to call the parent class constructor from the child class.

### Use Cases of the `super` Keyword:

1. **Access Parent Class Methods**: If the subclass has overridden a method, you can call the parent class’s version of the method using `super`.
2. **Access Parent Class Fields**: If the subclass has a field with the same name as in the parent class, you can use `super` to refer to the parent class’s field.
3. **Call Parent Class Constructor**: You can use `super()` to explicitly call the parent class constructor in the subclass constructor.

### 1. **Access Parent Class Methods**

If the subclass overrides a method of the parent class, you can still access the original version of the method from the parent class using `super.methodName()`.

#### Example:

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }

    void parentSound() {
        super.sound();  // Calls the sound method of the parent class (Animal)
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.sound();       // Output: Dog barks
        dog.parentSound(); // Output: Animal makes a sound
    }
}
```

In this example, `Dog` overrides the `sound()` method, but using `super.sound()`, the `Dog` class can still call the `sound()` method of the `Animal` class.

### 2. **Access Parent Class Fields**

If the child class has a field with the same name as the parent class, `super` helps distinguish between the parent class's field and the subclass's field.

#### Example:

```java
class Animal {
    String name = "Generic Animal";
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    String name = "Dog";

    void displayNames() {
        System.out.println("Child class name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Parent class name: " + super.name); // Accessing parent class field
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.displayNames();
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Child class name: Dog
Parent class name: Generic Animal
```

Here, the `super.name` is used to access the `name` field of the parent class, while `name` refers to the subclass field.

### 3. **Call Parent Class Constructor**

The `super()` keyword is used within the constructor of a subclass to invoke the constructor of its parent class. This is especially useful when the parent class has a constructor that initializes some fields, and you want to ensure that the parent class initialization happens before the child class constructor executes.

#### Example:

```java
class Animal {
    Animal(String name) {
        System.out.println("Animal constructor called. Name: " + name);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog(String name) {
        super(name);  // Calling parent class constructor
        System.out.println("Dog constructor called. Name: " + name);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog("Buddy");
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Animal constructor called. Name: Buddy
Dog constructor called. Name: Buddy
```

Here, the `super(name)` is used to call the `Animal` constructor, ensuring that the `Animal` class is initialized with the given name before the `Dog` class constructor executes.

### Points to Note:

- **`super()` must be the first statement** in the constructor if you are calling the parent class’s constructor. If it's not specified explicitly, Java adds an implicit call to the default constructor of the parent class.
- `super` can be used only within a subclass to refer to its immediate superclass.
- You cannot use `super` to call a superclass method from a static context because `super` works with object references.

### When to Use `super`

- When you want to access a parent class’s method that has been overridden in the subclass.
- When there are fields in the parent and subclass with the same name, and you need to refer to the parent class’s field.
- When you want to initialize the parent class by calling its constructor explicitly from the subclass.
