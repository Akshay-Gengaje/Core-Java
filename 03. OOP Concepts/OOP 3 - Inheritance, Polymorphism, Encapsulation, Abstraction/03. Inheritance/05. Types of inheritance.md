# Types of Inheritance -

In Java, **inheritance** allows one class to inherit the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of another class. This mechanism promotes reusability, code organization, and polymorphism. There are several types of inheritance based on how classes inherit from one another, though Java restricts some types to avoid issues like the Diamond Problem.

### Types of Inheritance:

1. **Single Inheritance**
2. **Multilevel Inheritance**
3. **Hierarchical Inheritance**
4. **Multiple Inheritance** (through interfaces)
5. **Hybrid Inheritance** (achieved through interfaces)

Let’s explore each type of inheritance in detail:

---

### 1. **Single Inheritance**

In **single inheritance**, a class inherits from only one parent class. This is the most basic form of inheritance and is commonly used in object-oriented programming. The subclass (child) inherits the properties and behaviors of the superclass (parent).

#### Example:

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {  // Dog inherits from Animal
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barking...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat();   // Inherited from Animal
        dog.bark();  // Defined in Dog
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Eating...
Barking...
```

Here, `Dog` is inheriting the `eat()` method from the `Animal` class. This is **single inheritance** because `Dog` has only one parent class.

---

### 2. **Multilevel Inheritance**

In **multilevel inheritance**, a class is derived from a class that is also derived from another class. In this way, a chain of inheritance is formed, where a class can inherit from a grandparent class through its parent class.

#### Example:

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Mammal extends Animal {  // Mammal inherits from Animal
    void walk() {
        System.out.println("Walking...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Mammal {  // Dog inherits from Mammal, and Mammal inherits from Animal
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barking...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat();   // Inherited from Animal
        dog.walk();  // Inherited from Mammal
        dog.bark();  // Defined in Dog
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Eating...
Walking...
Barking...
```

Here, `Dog` inherits from `Mammal`, which in turn inherits from `Animal`. This forms a multilevel inheritance chain.

---

### 3. **Hierarchical Inheritance**

In **hierarchical inheritance**, multiple classes inherit from a single parent class. This allows different classes to share the common features of the parent class while implementing their specific behaviors.

#### Example:

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barking...");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void meow() {
        System.out.println("Meowing...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        Cat cat = new Cat();

        dog.eat();   // Inherited from Animal
        dog.bark();  // Defined in Dog

        cat.eat();   // Inherited from Animal
        cat.meow();  // Defined in Cat
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Eating...
Barking...
Eating...
Meowing...
```

In this case, both `Dog` and `Cat` inherit the `eat()` method from the `Animal` class, but each has its specific behavior (`bark()` and `meow()`, respectively). This is **hierarchical inheritance** because multiple classes (`Dog`, `Cat`) inherit from a single parent class (`Animal`).

---

### 4. **Multiple Inheritance (via Interfaces)**

Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance with classes due to ambiguity issues like the **Diamond Problem**. However, Java supports **multiple inheritance** via **interfaces**. A class can implement multiple interfaces and inherit their behavior.

#### Example:

```java
interface Animal {
    void eat();
}

interface Bird {
    void fly();
}

class Bat implements Animal, Bird {  // Bat implements both interfaces
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Bat is eating.");
    }

    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Bat is flying.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bat bat = new Bat();
        bat.eat();
        bat.fly();
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Bat is eating.
Bat is flying.
```

Here, `Bat` implements both the `Animal` and `Bird` interfaces, achieving **multiple inheritance** through interfaces. The `Bat` class provides its own implementation of both the `eat()` and `fly()` methods.

---

### 5. **Hybrid Inheritance (achieved through interfaces)**

**Hybrid inheritance** is a combination of two or more types of inheritance (such as single, multilevel, and hierarchical). In Java, hybrid inheritance can only be achieved using interfaces, as Java does not allow multiple inheritance with classes.

#### Example:

```java
interface Vehicle {
    void move();
}

interface Engine {
    void start();
}

class Car implements Vehicle, Engine {
    @Override
    public void move() {
        System.out.println("Car is moving.");
    }

    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine is starting.");
    }
}

class ElectricCar extends Car {  // Inherits from Car (single inheritance)
    void charge() {
        System.out.println("Electric car is charging.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ElectricCar electricCar = new ElectricCar();
        electricCar.start();   // Inherited from Car
        electricCar.move();    // Inherited from Car
        electricCar.charge();  // Defined in ElectricCar
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Engine is starting.
Car is moving.
Electric car is charging.
```

In this example, **hybrid inheritance** is achieved by using both interfaces (`Vehicle` and `Engine`) and classes (`Car` and `ElectricCar`). The class `ElectricCar` inherits from `Car` (which implements multiple interfaces), forming a hybrid inheritance structure.

### Summary of Inheritance Types:

1. **Single Inheritance**: One class inherits from one parent class.
   
   - Example: `Dog extends Animal`

2. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A class inherits from a class that also inherits from another class.
   
   - Example: `Dog extends Mammal extends Animal`

3. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple classes inherit from a single parent class.
   
   - Example: `Dog extends Animal` and `Cat extends Animal`

4. **Multiple Inheritance (via Interfaces)**: A class implements multiple interfaces.
   
   - Example: `Bat implements Animal, Bird`

5. **Hybrid Inheritance (achieved through interfaces)**: A combination of two or more types of inheritance (typically involving interfaces).
   
   - Example: `ElectricCar extends Car implements Vehicle, Engine`

Each type of inheritance helps manage code reusability, modularity, and logical structure. While Java avoids the ambiguity of multiple inheritance with classes, interfaces provide a flexible way to model multiple behaviors.
