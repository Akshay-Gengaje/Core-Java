# Inheritance -

Inheritance in Java is a mechanism where one class (called the child or subclass) acquires the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of another class (called the parent or superclass). It allows for code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes, following the principle of **"is-a"** relationship.

### Key Concepts of Inheritance:

1. **Superclass (Parent Class)**: The class whose properties and methods are inherited.
2. **Subclass (Child Class)**: The class that inherits properties and methods from the superclass.

### Syntax:

In Java, the `extends` keyword is used to define inheritance.

```java
class Superclass {
    // fields and methods
}

class Subclass extends Superclass {
    // additional fields and methods
}
```

### Example:

```java
// Superclass
class Animal {
    String name;

    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

// Subclass
class Dog extends Animal {

    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.name = "Bulldog"; // Inherited property
        dog.eat();            // Inherited method
        dog.bark();           // Method of the Dog class
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
This animal eats food.
The dog barks.
```

In this example, the `Dog` class inherits the `name` field and the `eat()` method from the `Animal` class. Additionally, the `Dog` class has its own method `bark()`.

### Types of Inheritance in Java:

1. **Single Inheritance**: One class inherits from one parent class.
   
   ```java
   class A {}
   class B extends A {}
   ```

2. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A class inherits from another class, which is also a subclass of some other class.
   
   ```java
   class A {}
   class B extends A {}
   class C extends B {}
   ```

3. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple classes inherit from the same parent class.
   
   ```java
   class A {}
   class B extends A {}
   class C extends A {}
   ```

### Points to Note:

- **Java does not support multiple inheritance** (i.e., a class cannot extend more than one class) to avoid ambiguity. However, multiple inheritance is possible through interfaces.
- The `super` keyword is used to call a superclass's constructor or methods.
- Constructors are not inherited, but a subclass can call the superclass's constructor using `super()`.

### Advantages of Inheritance:

- **Code Reusability**: You can reuse fields and methods of an existing class.
- **Method Overriding**: A subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class.
- **Polymorphism**: Inheritance supports runtime polymorphism, which allows dynamic method binding.
