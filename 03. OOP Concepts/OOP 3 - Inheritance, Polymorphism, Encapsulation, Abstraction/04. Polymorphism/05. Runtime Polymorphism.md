# Runtime Polymorphism -

**Runtime polymorphism**, also known as **dynamic polymorphism** or **late binding**, is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where the method to be executed is determined at runtime based on the actual object type rather than the type of the reference variable. This allows for dynamic method resolution, providing greater flexibility and extensibility in code.

### Key Concepts of Runtime Polymorphism:

1. **Method Overriding**: Runtime polymorphism is primarily achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The subclass method overrides the superclass method.

2. **Dynamic Method Dispatch**: At runtime, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) decides which method implementation to call based on the actual object type rather than the reference type. This is known as dynamic method dispatch.

3. **Inheritance**: For runtime polymorphism to occur, inheritance must be used. The subclass must inherit from a superclass that contains the method to be overridden.

4. **Object Reference**: The reference variable of the superclass type is used to hold the object of the subclass. This reference variable can call overridden methods, and the correct method implementation is chosen based on the actual subclass type of the object.

5. **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**: Abstract classes and interfaces can be used to define methods that must be implemented by subclasses. The implementation of these methods can be overridden by concrete subclasses, allowing for runtime polymorphism.

### Example of Runtime Polymorphism

#### Superclass and Subclasses

```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}
```

#### Main Method to Demonstrate Runtime Polymorphism

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal;

        myAnimal = new Dog();
        myAnimal.makeSound(); // Output: Dog barks

        myAnimal = new Cat();
        myAnimal.makeSound(); // Output: Cat meows
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:

- In this example, the `makeSound()` method is overridden in the `Dog` and `Cat` subclasses.
- The reference variable `myAnimal` of type `Animal` holds objects of type `Dog` and `Cat`.
- At runtime, based on the actual object type (`Dog` or `Cat`), the appropriate `makeSound()` method is called.

### How Runtime Polymorphism Works

1. **Reference Variable**: An object reference of the superclass type is created, which can hold instances of any subclass.
   
   ```java
   Animal myAnimal;
   ```

2. **Object Instantiation**: The reference variable is assigned an object of a subclass.
   
   ```java
   myAnimal = new Dog();
   ```

3. **Method Call**: When a method is called on the reference variable, the JVM determines which subclass implementation to execute based on the actual object type.
   
   ```java
   myAnimal.makeSound(); // Calls Dog's makeSound() method
   ```

4. **Dynamic Method Dispatch**: The JVM uses a method table (vtable) for each object, which contains pointers to the actual method implementations. During method invocation, the JVM looks up the method in the vtable of the object's actual type.

### Benefits of Runtime Polymorphism

1. **Flexibility**: Allows for flexible code that can work with objects of different types through a common interface or superclass.

2. **Extensibility**: New subclasses can be added with their own implementations of methods without modifying existing code.

3. **Code Reusability**: Promotes the reuse of code by allowing common methods to be defined in the superclass and overridden in subclasses.

4. **Maintainability**: Makes code easier to maintain and extend by adhering to the open-closed principle, where classes are open for extension but closed for modification.

### Example with Abstract Classes and Interfaces

#### Abstract Class Example

```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle");
    }
}
```

#### Interface Example

```java
interface Drawable {
    void draw();
}

class Triangle implements Drawable {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a triangle");
    }
}

class Square implements Drawable {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a square");
    }
}
```

#### Main Method Demonstrating Polymorphism

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape shape;
        shape = new Circle();
        shape.draw(); // Output: Drawing a circle

        shape = new Rectangle();
        shape.draw(); // Output: Drawing a rectangle

        Drawable drawable;
        drawable = new Triangle();
        drawable.draw(); // Output: Drawing a triangle

        drawable = new Square();
        drawable.draw(); // Output: Drawing a square
    }
}
```

### Limitations of Runtime Polymorphism

1. **Performance Overhead**: There is a slight performance overhead due to dynamic method dispatch, although this is typically negligible in most applications.

2. **Complexity**: Understanding and debugging runtime polymorphism can sometimes be challenging, especially in large codebases with deep inheritance hierarchies.

3. **Cannot Override Private Methods**: Private methods cannot be overridden. They can be inherited, but not overridden.

### Summary

- **Runtime Polymorphism** allows the method to be determined and executed at runtime based on the object's actual type.
- It is achieved through method overriding and dynamic method dispatch.
- Benefits include flexibility, extensibility, and code reusability.
- **Abstract classes** and **interfaces** can be used to leverage runtime polymorphism effectively.
