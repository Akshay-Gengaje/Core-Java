# Compile Time Polymorphism -

**Compile-time polymorphism** (also known as **static polymorphism**) refers to the ability of a method to be resolved during the compilation process. It is primarily achieved through **method overloading** or **operator overloading** (although Java doesn’t support operator overloading). In Java, method overloading is the main mechanism to achieve compile-time polymorphism.

### What is Method Overloading?

Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but differing in:

1. The number of parameters.
2. The type of parameters.
3. The order of parameters.

In method overloading, the decision about which method to call is made at compile time based on the method signature (method name, number of parameters, and types of parameters). Hence, it's called **compile-time** or **static polymorphism**.

### How Compile-time Polymorphism Works?

The compiler uses method signatures to distinguish between overloaded methods. When you invoke an overloaded method, the compiler matches the method call with the correct method definition based on the number, type, and order of the parameters.

Here’s how the overloading concept works:

#### Example of Method Overloading:

```java
class Calculator {
    // Method to add two integers
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Overloaded method to add three integers
    int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }

    // Overloaded method to add two double values
    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();

        System.out.println(calc.add(5, 10));        // Calls add(int, int)
        System.out.println(calc.add(5, 10, 15));    // Calls add(int, int, int)
        System.out.println(calc.add(5.5, 10.5));    // Calls add(double, double)
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
15
30
16.0
```

#### Explanation:

- The `add(int, int)` method adds two integers.
- The `add(int, int, int)` method adds three integers.
- The `add(double, double)` method adds two double values.

Based on the parameters passed when calling the `add` method, the compiler determines which method to call during compile time. This is why it is called **compile-time polymorphism**.

### Rules of Method Overloading:

1. **Different number of parameters**: Methods can be overloaded by changing the number of parameters.
   
   ```java
   void print(int a);
   void print(int a, int b);
   ```

2. **Different types of parameters**: Methods can be overloaded by changing the types of parameters.
   
   ```java
   void print(int a);
   void print(double a);
   ```

3. **Order of parameters**: Methods can also be overloaded by changing the order of parameters (with at least one differing type).
   
   ```java
   void display(int a, double b);
   void display(double a, int b);
   ```

### What Cannot Be Used for Method Overloading?

1. **Return type**: The return type alone is not sufficient for overloading. This means you cannot have two methods with the same signature but different return types.
   
   ```java
   int display(int a);   // Compiler error if you try to overload based on return type only.
   double display(int a);
   ```
   
   The above code will not compile because method overloading must differ in parameters (number or type), not return type.

2. **Modifiers**: Changing access modifiers (e.g., `public`, `private`, `protected`) does not overload methods. It only changes the visibility of the method, but the signature must still be different.

### Benefits of Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)

1. **Readability**: Method overloading allows the developer to define multiple methods with the same name, which makes the class API more intuitive and easier to read. For example, having multiple `print()` methods with different parameter types is more readable than having `printInt()`, `printDouble()`, etc.

2. **Code Organization**: You can perform similar but slightly different operations under one method name, making the code more organized and cleaner.

3. **Reusability**: Code is more reusable because you can reuse the method name and just provide different parameters depending on the task at hand.

### Overloading with Type Promotion

Sometimes, when you call a method, the arguments you pass are automatically promoted to a higher data type. For instance, if you call a method expecting an `int` but pass a `byte`, the `byte` is promoted to an `int` before the method is invoked.

#### Example:

```java
class Demo {
    void show(int a) {
        System.out.println("int method: " + a);
    }

    void show(double a) {
        System.out.println("double method: " + a);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Demo obj = new Demo();
        obj.show(10);        // Calls the int method
        obj.show(10.5);      // Calls the double method
        obj.show('a');       // 'a' is promoted to int (ASCII value of 'a')
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
int method: 10
double method: 10.5
int method: 97
```

In the example above, the method `show(char)` does not exist. However, `'a'` is promoted to its ASCII value (97), which is an `int`, and the `show(int)` method is called.

### Method Overloading and Varargs

Java allows you to overload methods by using **varargs** (variable-length arguments). Varargs allow you to pass zero or more arguments of a specific type to a method.

#### Example:

```java
class Demo {
    void show(int a) {
        System.out.println("int method: " + a);
    }

    void show(int... a) {
        System.out.println("varargs method: " + a.length + " arguments");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Demo obj = new Demo();
        obj.show(10);        // Calls the int method
        obj.show(10, 20, 30);  // Calls the varargs method
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
int method: 10
varargs method: 3 arguments
```

When you pass multiple arguments, the varargs method is invoked. When you pass a single argument, the `show(int)` method is called.

### Why Use Compile-time Polymorphism?

1. **Simplicity**: With method overloading, developers don’t have to remember multiple method names for similar tasks. They can use one method name with different parameter lists, making it easier to understand.

2. **Code Maintainability**: It helps maintain a cleaner and more organized codebase, where methods can be grouped by behavior under one name. This promotes better code maintainability.

3. **Consistency**: If you are performing similar operations but on different types of data, method overloading provides a consistent way to handle different data types under one method name.

4. **Flexibility**: Compile-time polymorphism gives flexibility in defining methods that perform the same general function but on different data types or with a different number of arguments.

### Limitations of Compile-time Polymorphism

1. **Less Flexibility at Runtime**: Since compile-time polymorphism resolves method calls at compile time, it lacks the flexibility offered by runtime polymorphism. For example, you cannot change the method to be called dynamically based on object type.

2. **Cannot Overload Based on Return Type Alone**: Java doesn’t allow method overloading if the only difference is in return type. The method signature must differ in the number or types of parameters.

---

### Summary:

- **Compile-time polymorphism** in Java is achieved through **method overloading**.
- It allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types, counts, or orders.
- The compiler determines which method to call based on the method signature during compilation.
- It improves code readability and reuse, while also keeping methods logically grouped.
- It has limitations, such as not allowing overloading based on return type alone and offering less flexibility than runtime polymorphism.
