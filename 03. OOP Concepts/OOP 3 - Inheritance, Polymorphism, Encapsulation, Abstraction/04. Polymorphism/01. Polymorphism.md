# Polymorphism in Java -

**Polymorphism** is one of the four fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), alongside **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and **abstraction**. In simple terms, polymorphism means "many forms." It allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common super type. Polymorphism enables one interface or method to be used for different types of actions or behaviors.

### Types of Polymorphism in Java:

1. **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)**:
   
   - Achieved using **method overloading**.
   - The method to be executed is determined at **compile time**.

2. **Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)**:
   
   - Achieved using **method overriding**.
   - The method to be executed is determined at **runtime**.

Letâ€™s explore each type in depth.

### 1. **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)**

Compile-time polymorphism is achieved through **method overloading**. This means that a class can have multiple methods with the same name, but with different parameter types or number of parameters. The correct method to call is determined at compile time based on the arguments passed to the method.

#### Example of Method Overloading:

```java
class Calculator {
    // Method to add two integers
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Overloaded method to add three integers
    int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }

    // Overloaded method to add two double values
    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        System.out.println(calc.add(5, 10));       // Calls add(int, int)
        System.out.println(calc.add(5, 10, 15));   // Calls add(int, int, int)
        System.out.println(calc.add(5.5, 10.5));   // Calls add(double, double)
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
15
30
16.0
```

In this example, the `add` method is **overloaded** with different parameter types and counts. At **compile time**, the appropriate method is chosen based on the number and type of arguments passed.

#### Characteristics of Compile-time Polymorphism:

- Achieved through **method overloading** or **operator overloading** (though Java does not support operator overloading directly).
- The binding of the method call is done at **compile time**.
- **Faster execution** since the method to be called is known at compile time.

---

### 2. **Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)**

Runtime polymorphism is achieved through **method overriding**. In this case, the method that is called is determined at runtime, based on the actual object that invokes the method. This form of polymorphism allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

#### Example of Method Overriding:

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal = new Animal();
        Animal myDog = new Dog();  // Upcasting: Dog object as Animal reference
        Animal myCat = new Cat();  // Upcasting: Cat object as Animal reference

        myAnimal.sound();  // Calls Animal's sound method
        myDog.sound();     // Calls Dog's overridden sound method
        myCat.sound();     // Calls Cat's overridden sound method
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Animal makes a sound
Dog barks
Cat meows
```

In this example, the `sound` method is **overridden** in the `Dog` and `Cat` subclasses. At **runtime**, the JVM determines which `sound` method to call based on the object that the method is called upon, even if the reference type is of the superclass `Animal`.

#### Characteristics of Runtime Polymorphism:

- Achieved through **method overriding**.
- The binding of the method call is done at **runtime**.
- **Slower execution** compared to compile-time polymorphism because method binding occurs at runtime.
- Promotes **flexibility** and **extensibility** in code.

### Polymorphism and Inheritance

Polymorphism is closely tied to **inheritance**. The ability to use a **superclass reference** to refer to an **object of a subclass** is one of the key benefits of polymorphism.

#### Example:

```java
class Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a shape");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

class Square extends Shape {
    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a square");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape s1 = new Circle();  // Upcasting
        Shape s2 = new Square();  // Upcasting

        s1.draw();  // Calls Circle's draw method
        s2.draw();  // Calls Square's draw method
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Drawing a circle
Drawing a square
```

Here, both `s1` and `s2` are references of type `Shape` but refer to objects of type `Circle` and `Square`, respectively. At runtime, the actual method to invoke (`Circle` or `Square`'s `draw` method) is determined, illustrating polymorphism.

---

### Polymorphism with Interfaces

Polymorphism is also achieved through **interfaces**. A class can implement an interface and provide different implementations of the same method.

#### Example:

```java
interface Vehicle {
    void move();
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void move() {
        System.out.println("Car is moving");
    }
}

class Bike implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void move() {
        System.out.println("Bike is moving");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle v1 = new Car();  // Upcasting
        Vehicle v2 = new Bike(); // Upcasting

        v1.move();  // Calls Car's move method
        v2.move();  // Calls Bike's move method
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Car is moving
Bike is moving
```

Here, the `move` method is called on `Vehicle` references, but the actual implementation is provided by `Car` and `Bike`. This is another form of **runtime polymorphism**.

### Benefits of Polymorphism:

1. **Code Reusability**: Polymorphism allows classes to be reused in different contexts. For example, you can write generic code that works with superclass references but operates on subclass objects.

2. **Extensibility**: You can add new subclasses without modifying existing code. As long as new classes follow the method signatures of the parent class or implement interfaces, they can be used in existing code without changes.

3. **Simplified Code Maintenance**: Using polymorphism, you can centralize behavior in a superclass or interface and allow subclasses to provide specific behavior. This makes code easier to maintain and extend.

4. **Reduced Coupling**: Polymorphism allows objects to be loosely coupled. Code depends on abstract classes or interfaces rather than concrete implementations, making it easier to swap implementations if needed.

### Summary of Key Concepts:

- **Compile-time Polymorphism**: Achieved through **method overloading**; the method is selected at compile time.
- **Runtime Polymorphism**: Achieved through **method overriding**; the method is selected at runtime based on the actual object.
- **Polymorphism and Inheritance**: Polymorphism is deeply connected to inheritance, where a superclass reference can point to subclass objects, allowing dynamic method dispatch.
- **Polymorphism with Interfaces**: Interfaces allow different classes to implement the same methods and provide different behavior, promoting runtime polymorphism.
