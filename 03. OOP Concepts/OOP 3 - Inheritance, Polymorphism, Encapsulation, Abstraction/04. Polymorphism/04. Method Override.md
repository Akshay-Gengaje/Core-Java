# Method Override -

**Method overriding** is a fundamental concept in Java that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. It is a key aspect of **runtime polymorphism** (or dynamic polymorphism) and enables objects to exhibit behaviors based on their actual runtime types rather than their compile-time types.

### Key Points of Method Overriding:

1. **Same Method Signature**: The overriding method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameter list as the method in the superclass. This ensures that the method signature matches exactly.

2. **Inheritance**: Overriding requires inheritance. The subclass must inherit from a superclass that contains the method to be overridden.

3. **Access Modifiers**: The overriding method in the subclass must have the same or more permissive access level as the method in the superclass. For example, if the superclass method is `protected`, the overriding method can be `protected` or `public`, but not `private`.

4. **Return Type**: The return type of the overriding method must be the same as, or a subtype of, the return type of the method in the superclass. This is known as **covariant return type**.

5. **Exception Handling**: The overriding method can throw fewer exceptions or the same exceptions as the method in the superclass but cannot throw new or broader exceptions. This ensures that the subclass method does not introduce unexpected exceptions.

6. **`super` Keyword**: The `super` keyword can be used within an overriding method to call the superclass method.

7. **Final Methods**: Methods declared as `final` in the superclass cannot be overridden. This prevents subclass modification of such methods.

8. **Static Methods**: Static methods cannot be overridden. If a subclass defines a static method with the same name as a static method in its superclass, it hides the superclass method rather than overriding it.

### Example of Method Overriding

#### Superclass Definition

```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}
```

#### Subclass Overriding the Method

```java
class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

#### Main Method to Demonstrate Overriding

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal = new Animal();
        Animal myDog = new Dog();

        myAnimal.makeSound(); // Output: Animal makes a sound
        myDog.makeSound();   // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `makeSound()` method in `Animal` is overridden by the `makeSound()` method in `Dog`.
- When `makeSound()` is called on an instance of `Dog`, the overridden method in `Dog` is executed, demonstrating runtime polymorphism.

### Rules for Method Overriding

1. **Method Signature**: The overriding method must have the exact same method signature as the method in the superclass.
   
   ```java
   // Superclass
   void display(int a);
   
   // Subclass
   @Override
   void display(int a);
   ```

2. **Access Level**: The overriding method cannot be more restrictive than the method in the superclass. For example:
   
   ```java
   // Superclass
   protected void display(int a);
   
   // Valid overriding methods
   @Override
   public void display(int a); // Public is less restrictive than protected
   ```

3. **Return Type**: The return type must be the same or a subtype of the return type of the overridden method.
   
   ```java
   // Superclass
   Number getValue();
   
   // Subclass
   @Override
   Integer getValue(); // Integer is a subtype of Number
   ```

4. **Exceptions**: The overriding method can only throw the same or fewer exceptions.
   
   ```java
   // Superclass
   void process() throws IOException;
   
   // Valid overriding methods
   @Override
   void process(); // No exceptions
   @Override
   void process() throws IOException; // Same exception
   ```

5. **`final`, `static`, and `private` Methods**: Methods declared as `final`, `static`, or `private` cannot be overridden.
   
   ```java
   // Superclass
   final void display(); // Cannot be overridden
   
   // Subclass
   @Override
   void display(); // Compiler error
   ```

### Benefits of Method Overriding

1. **Runtime Polymorphism**: Allows dynamic method binding, enabling a method to behave differently depending on the runtime type of the object.

2. **Code Reusability**: Promotes code reusability by allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations while reusing superclass code.

3. **Flexibility**: Enhances flexibility and maintainability by allowing subclasses to customize or extend the behavior of superclass methods.

4. **Dynamic Method Resolution**: Facilitates dynamic method resolution, where the method to be invoked is determined at runtime based on the object's actual type.

### Example with Super Keyword

```java
class Base {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Base display");
    }
}

class Derived extends Base {
    @Override
    void display() {
        super.display(); // Calls the superclass method
        System.out.println("Derived display");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Derived obj = new Derived();
        obj.display();
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Base display
Derived display
```

In this example, the `super.display()` call in the `Derived` class invokes the `display()` method of the `Base` class before executing its own implementation.

### Limitations of Method Overriding

1. **No Overloading**: Overriding is different from overloading. Overriding requires the exact same method signature, while overloading requires a different method signature.

2. **`final` Methods**: Methods declared as `final` cannot be overridden, which limits the ability to change their behavior in subclasses.

3. **`static` Methods**: `static` methods are not subject to overriding; they are hidden instead, which means the method resolution is based on the reference type rather than the object type.

### Summary

- **Method Overriding** allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.
- It requires the same method signature and can only be more permissive in access level.
- It supports runtime polymorphism, allowing dynamic method binding.
- **`super`** keyword can be used to call the superclass method from the subclass.
