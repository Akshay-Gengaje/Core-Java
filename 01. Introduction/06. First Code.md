# Java First Code -

```java 
public class HelloWorld { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");     
    }
}
```

Sure! Let's break down each important keyword and concept in the "Hello, World!" Java program.

### 1. `public`

- **What it is:** `public` is an access modifier.
- **Use:** It defines the visibility of the class or method. When a class or method is declared as `public`, it can be accessed from any other class in the program.
- **Why it's written:** The `main` method needs to be `public` because it must be accessible to the Java runtime environment, which starts the execution of the program.

### 2. `class`

- **What it is:** `class` is a keyword used to define a class in Java.
- **Use:** A class is a blueprint from which objects are created. It encapsulates data for the object and methods to manipulate that data.
- **Why it's written:** In Java, every piece of code must be inside a class. The `HelloWorld` class is used to group together the `main` method.

### 3. `HelloWorld`

- **What it is:** `HelloWorld` is the name of the class.
- **Use:** It identifies the class in the program. This name should follow Java naming conventions (start with a capital letter and use camelCase).
- **Why it's written:** This is an identifier for the class and must match the file name (i.e., `HelloWorld.java`). It's where the program logic resides.

### 4. `static`

- **What it is:** `static` is a keyword that means the method belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class.
- **Use:** A `static` method can be called without creating an instance of the class.
- **Why it's written:** The `main` method is static because it is called by the Java runtime without creating any object of the class. This allows the program to be executed without instantiating the `HelloWorld` class.

### 5. `void`

- **What it is:** `void` is a return type that indicates the method does not return any value.
- **Use:** It tells the compiler that the `main` method will not return any data after execution.
- **Why it's written:** The `main` method is not supposed to return any value to the Java runtime environment, hence it is declared with the `void` return type.

### 6. `main`

- **What it is:** `main` is the name of the method where the program begins execution.
- **Use:** This is the entry point of the program. The Java runtime environment looks for this method signature to start executing the program.
- **Why it's written:** Without the `main` method, the program wouldn’t know where to start its execution.

### 7. `String[] args`

- **What it is:** This is an array of `String` objects.
- **Use:** It stores command-line arguments passed to the program when it is executed. `args` is just a variable name, and it can be changed, but `String[]` must remain the same to accept arguments.
- **Why it's written:** Even if you don’t use command-line arguments, this parameter is necessary because the `main` method signature requires it. It's how the Java runtime environment passes arguments to your program.

### 8. `System`

- **What it is:** `System` is a class in the `java.lang` package.
- **Use:** It contains several useful class fields and methods, one of which is `out`.
- **Why it's written:** We use `System` to access the `out` object, which allows us to output text to the console.

### 9. `out`

- **What it is:** `out` is a static field in the `System` class.
- **Use:** `out` is an instance of `PrintStream`, which has methods for printing data to the console.
- **Why it's written:** `System.out` is the standard output stream, which is used to print text to the console.

### 10. `println`

- **What it is:** `println` is a method of the `PrintStream` class.
- **Use:** It prints the argument passed to it, followed by a new line.
- **Why it's written:** This method is used to output text to the console. The "ln" in `println` stands for "line," meaning it ends the line after printing, which is why each output appears on a new line.

### 11. `"Hello, World!"`

- **What it is:** This is a string literal.
- **Use:** It represents a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.
- **Why it's written:** The `println` method prints this string to the console. The text inside the quotes can be changed to print different messages.

### 12. `;`

- **What it is:** This is a semicolon.
- **Use:** It marks the end of a statement in Java.
- **Why it's written:** Java requires a semicolon at the end of each statement to indicate that the statement is complete. It’s similar to a period at the end of a sentence in English.

### Summary of How it All Comes Together:

- The program starts with the `main` method, which is public so the Java runtime can access it. The method is static so that it can be called without creating an object of the class. The method does not return anything (`void`), and it can accept an array of strings as arguments (`String[] args`).
- Inside the `main` method, `System.out.println` is used to print "Hello, World!" to the console. The string literal "Hello, World!" is the message being printed, and the semicolon marks the end of the statement. 

This is how the basic structure of a Java program works, allowing it to execute and print output to the console.
