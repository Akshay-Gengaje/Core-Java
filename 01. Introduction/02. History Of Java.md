# The Complete History of Java Programming Language

#### **1. Origins of Java**

Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by **James Gosling** and his team at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. The original intention was to create a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes and televisions. Initially, the team considered using C++, but it was rejected due to its high memory requirements and complexity. Instead of modifying C++, Gosling decided to create a new language and platform called **Green**.

#### **2. The Birth of "Oak"**

The initial project was named "Greentalk," and its files used the `.gt` extension. However, the project was later renamed to "Oak." The name "Oak" was inspired by an oak tree that stood outside James Gosling's office. Additionally, the oak tree symbolized strength and was recognized as the national tree in several countries, including the U.S.A., France, and Germany.

#### **3. The Transition to "Java"**

The name "Oak" was already trademarked by another company (Oak Technologies), which forced the team to find a new name. After a brainstorming session, they considered several names like DNA, SILK, RUBY, and JAVA. Ultimately, the name "Java" was chosen, inspired by a type of coffee bean that Gosling encountered during a coffee break.

Java was built on the principles of being **robust, portable, platform-independent, high-performance, and multithreaded**. TIME Magazine recognized Java as one of the "Ten Best Products of 1995."
