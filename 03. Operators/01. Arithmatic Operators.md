# Arithmatic Operators 

Arithmetic operators in Java are used to perform mathematical operations on numerical data types, such as `int`, `float`, `double`, and `long`. These operators are fundamental to any programming language and allow you to execute basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

### List of Arithmetic Operators

Java provides the following arithmetic operators:

1. **Addition (`+`)**
2. **Subtraction (`-`)**
3. **Multiplication (`*`)**
4. **Division (`/`)**
5. **Modulus (`%`)**
6. **Increment (`++`)**
7. **Decrement (`--`)**

### 1. Addition (`+`)

The addition operator is used to add two operands.

- **Syntax**: `operand1 + operand2`
- **Examples**:
  ```java
  int a = 10;
  int b = 20;
  int sum = a + b; // sum is 30
  ```

- **Behavior**:
  - **Numeric Types**: Adds two numbers.
  - **String Concatenation**: If either operand is a string, the `+` operator concatenates the operands.
  ```java
  String greeting = "Hello, " + "world!"; // greeting is "Hello, world!"
  ```

### 2. Subtraction (`-`)

The subtraction operator is used to subtract the right operand from the left operand.

- **Syntax**: `operand1 - operand2`
- **Examples**:
  ```java
  int a = 20;
  int b = 10;
  int difference = a - b; // difference is 10
  ```

### 3. Multiplication (`*`)

The multiplication operator is used to multiply two operands.

- **Syntax**: `operand1 * operand2`
- **Examples**:
  ```java
  int a = 10;
  int b = 5;
  int product = a * b; // product is 50
  ```

### 4. Division (`/`)

The division operator is used to divide the left operand by the right operand.

- **Syntax**: `operand1 / operand2`
- **Examples**:
  ```java
  int a = 20;
  int b = 5;
  int quotient = a / b; // quotient is 4
  ```

- **Behavior**:
  - **Integer Division**: When both operands are integers, the result is an integer, with any fractional part truncated.
  ```java
  int result = 7 / 2; // result is 3, not 3.5
  ```
  - **Floating-Point Division**: If either operand is a floating-point type (`float` or `double`), the result will be a floating-point value.
  ```java
  double result = 7.0 / 2; // result is 3.5
  ```

- **Special Cases**:
  - **Division by Zero**:
    - **Integer Division**: Dividing by zero with integers (`int` or `long`) will throw an `ArithmeticException`.
    - **Floating-Point Division**: Dividing by zero with floating-point numbers results in positive or negative infinity (`Infinity` or `-Infinity`), or `NaN` (Not a Number) if the dividend is also zero.
    ```java
    double result = 10.0 / 0.0; // result is Infinity
    double result2 = 0.0 / 0.0; // result2 is NaN
    ```

### 5. Modulus (`%`)

The modulus operator returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.

- **Syntax**: `operand1 % operand2`
- **Examples**:
  ```java
  int a = 10;
  int b = 3;
  int remainder = a % b; // remainder is 1
  ```

- **Behavior**:
  - **Integer Types**: Returns the remainder of the division.
  - **Floating-Point Types**: It can also be used with floating-point numbers, where it returns the remainder of division in floating-point.
  ```java
  double result = 10.5 % 3.0; // result is 1.5
  ```

- **Special Cases**:
  - **Modulus with Zero**:
    - Modulus by zero will throw an `ArithmeticException` if the operands are integers. For floating-point numbers, the result is `NaN`.

### 6. Increment (`++`)

The increment operator increases the value of a variable by 1.

- **Syntax**:
  - **Prefix**: `++operand`
  - **Postfix**: `operand++`
- **Examples**:
  ```java
  int a = 5;
  int b = ++a; // a is incremented first, then b is assigned the value of a, so a = 6, b = 6

  int c = 5;
  int d = c++; // d is assigned the value of c first, then c is incremented, so c = 6, d = 5
  ```

- **Behavior**:
  - **Prefix Increment (`++a`)**: The value of `a` is incremented before its current value is used in the expression.
  - **Postfix Increment (`a++`)**: The current value of `a` is used in the expression before it is incremented.

### 7. Decrement (`--`)

The decrement operator decreases the value of a variable by 1.

- **Syntax**:
  - **Prefix**: `--operand`
  - **Postfix**: `operand--`
- **Examples**:
  ```java
  int a = 5;
  int b = --a; // a is decremented first, then b is assigned the value of a, so a = 4, b = 4

  int c = 5;
  int d = c--; // d is assigned the value of c first, then c is decremented, so c = 4, d = 5
  ```

- **Behavior**:
  - **Prefix Decrement (`--a`)**: The value of `a` is decremented before its current value is used in the expression.
  - **Postfix Decrement (`a--`)**: The current value of `a` is used in the expression before it is decremented.

### Precedence and Associativity of Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators follow specific rules of precedence and associativity, which determine the order in which operations are evaluated.

- **Precedence**:
  1. **`++`, `--`** (highest precedence, when used as prefix)
  2. **`*`, `/`, `%`**
  3. **`+`, `-`**
  4. **`++`, `--`** (lowest precedence, when used as postfix)

- **Associativity**:
  - All arithmetic operators have **left-to-right** associativity, except for increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) when used as a prefix, which have **right-to-left** associativity.

- **Example**:
  ```java
  int result = 10 + 5 * 2; // result is 20, not 30 (multiplication has higher precedence than addition)
  int result2 = (10 + 5) * 2; // result is 30, parentheses change the order of evaluation
  ```

### Summary

Arithmetic operators in Java are crucial for performing basic mathematical operations. Understanding these operators, their behavior, and how they interact with different data types is essential for effective Java programming. By mastering these operators, you can efficiently manipulate data and perform complex calculations within your Java programs.
