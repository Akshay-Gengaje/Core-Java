# Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators in Java are used to perform operations on individual bits of integer data types (`byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`). These operators are fundamental in low-level programming, where operations on binary representations of numbers are required. Bitwise operations are useful in a variety of applications, including system programming, cryptography, and performance optimization in algorithms.

### List of Bitwise Operators

Java provides the following bitwise operators:

1. **AND (`&`)**
2. **OR (`|`)**
3. **XOR (`^`)**
4. **Complement (`~`)**
5. **Left Shift (`<<`)**
6. **Right Shift (`>>`)**
7. **Unsigned Right Shift (`>>>`)**

### 1. Bitwise AND (`&`)

The bitwise AND operator compares each bit of its two operands. If both bits are `1`, the corresponding bit in the result is set to `1`. Otherwise, it is set to `0`.

- **Syntax**: `operand1 & operand2`
- **Example**:
  ```java
  int a = 5; // In binary: 0101
  int b = 3; // In binary: 0011
  int result = a & b; // result is 1 (In binary: 0001)
  ```

  **Explanation**:
  ```
  0101 (a)
  0011 (b)
  ----
  0001 (result)
  ```

### 2. Bitwise OR (`|`)

The bitwise OR operator compares each bit of its two operands. If at least one of the bits is `1`, the corresponding bit in the result is set to `1`. Otherwise, it is set to `0`.

- **Syntax**: `operand1 | operand2`
- **Example**:
  ```java
  int a = 5; // In binary: 0101
  int b = 3; // In binary: 0011
  int result = a | b; // result is 7 (In binary: 0111)
  ```

  **Explanation**:
  ```
  0101 (a)
  0011 (b)
  ----
  0111 (result)
  ```

### 3. Bitwise XOR (`^`)

The bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator compares each bit of its two operands. If the bits are different (one is `1` and the other is `0`), the corresponding bit in the result is set to `1`. Otherwise, it is set to `0`.

- **Syntax**: `operand1 ^ operand2`
- **Example**:
  ```java
  int a = 5; // In binary: 0101
  int b = 3; // In binary: 0011
  int result = a ^ b; // result is 6 (In binary: 0110)
  ```

  **Explanation**:
  ```
  0101 (a)
  0011 (b)
  ----
  0110 (result)
  ```

### 4. Bitwise Complement (`~`)

The bitwise complement operator inverts all the bits of its operand. It turns `1`s into `0`s and `0`s into `1`s.

- **Syntax**: `~operand`
- **Example**:
  ```java
  int a = 5; // In binary: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000101
  int result = ~a; // result is -6 (In binary: 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111010)
  ```

  **Explanation**:
  - The result of the complement operation is the two's complement of the original number plus one, effectively flipping the sign of the number and subtracting one.
  ```
  00000000 00000000 00000000 00000101 (a)
  11111111 11111111 11111111 11111010 (result)
  ```

### 5. Left Shift (`<<`)

The left shift operator shifts all the bits of its operand to the left by a specified number of positions. The empty positions on the right are filled with zeros.

- **Syntax**: `operand << numberOfPositions`
- **Example**:
  ```java
  int a = 5; // In binary: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000101
  int result = a << 1; // result is 10 (In binary: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00001010)
  ```

  **Explanation**:
  - Shifting left by one position is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2.
  ```
  00000000 00000000 00000000 00000101 (a)
  00000000 00000000 00000000 00001010 (result)
  ```

### 6. Right Shift (`>>`)

The right shift operator shifts all the bits of its operand to the right by a specified number of positions. The empty positions on the left are filled with the sign bit (0 for positive numbers, 1 for negative numbers).

- **Syntax**: `operand >> numberOfPositions`
- **Example**:
  ```java
  int a = 5; // In binary: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000101
  int result = a >> 1; // result is 2 (In binary: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000010)
  ```

  **Explanation**:
  - Shifting right by one position is equivalent to dividing the number by 2.
  ```
  00000000 00000000 00000000 00000101 (a)
  00000000 00000000 00000000 00000010 (result)
  ```

- **Special Case**:
  - For negative numbers, the sign bit is preserved, so the number remains negative after the shift.

### 7. Unsigned Right Shift (`>>>`)

The unsigned right shift operator shifts all the bits of its operand to the right by a specified number of positions. The empty positions on the left are filled with zeros, regardless of the sign of the number.

- **Syntax**: `operand >>> numberOfPositions`
- **Example**:
  ```java
  int a = -5; // In binary: 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111011
  int result = a >>> 1; // result is 2147483645 (In binary: 01111111 11111111 11111111 11111101)
  ```

  **Explanation**:
  - The unsigned right shift always fills the leftmost bits with `0`, effectively treating the number as unsigned.
  ```
  11111111 11111111 11111111 11111011 (a)
  01111111 11111111 11111111 11111101 (result)
  ```

### Practical Applications of Bitwise Operators

1. **Setting, Clearing, and Toggling Bits**: You can use bitwise operators to manipulate individual bits within a byte or integer, which is useful in low-level programming such as device drivers or communication protocols.
2. **Efficient Arithmetic**: Left and right shifts are often used for efficient multiplication or division by powers of 2.
3. **Bitmasking**: Bitwise operations are essential in bitmasking techniques, where certain bits are selected or modified while leaving others unchanged.
4. **Cryptography and Data Compression**: Bitwise operations are fundamental in algorithms for encryption, decryption, and data compression.

### Summary

Bitwise operators in Java provide a way to manipulate individual bits of integral data types, enabling powerful and efficient low-level programming techniques. Understanding and effectively using bitwise operators allows developers to perform tasks that would be cumbersome or impossible with standard arithmetic operators.
